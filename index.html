        <p>I'm currently working in Pittsburgh as an IT professional, but my true passion is software and entrepreneurship. I love thinking about what could be and I believe that with enough passion, we can solve the worlds biggest problems. If I had it my way, I'd travel the world, run my own business, and play in a band at night. Is there a job for that?</p>
